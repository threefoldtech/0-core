## Boot Options

Zero-OS handles the following kernel params:
* `debug` sets the initial log level to debug, can be changed later via the client.
* `organization=<org>` When set, Zero-OS will only accept ItsYou.online signed JWT tokens that have the `user:memberof:<org>` role set and are valid
If not provided, zero-os will not require a password
* `zerotier=<id>` Join this zerotier network on boot
* `ztid=<identity>` Full zerotier `identity.secret` [optional]. If not provided a one will get generated for you. Zero-OS does the best effort to generate the same one every time it boots.
* `development` If set, start the redis-proxy allow direct client connections, also opening the required client ports. If not set, no direct client connections
will be allowed
* `support` If set, gives unconditional access to our staff (threefold sysadmin) members. Please only add this if specially required

## Booting modes
Different booting modes can be achieved by mixing and matching the boot params documented above.

### production:
```
zerotier=<network-id>
```

### development:
```
development [zerotier=<networkd-id>]
```
zerotier if not set, both the robot and the redis server can be reached over all interfaces


> Adding `debug` param to any of the above flag combinations will output verbose logs.
