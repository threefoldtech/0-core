# Streaming process output from Zero-OS
The generic command flags has a `stream` flag. When set to true Zero-OS also makes sure
to push (RPUSH) the command output and error stream to a special queue names `stream:<id>`

Each entry in the queue is a json serialized object structured as following

```javascript
{
	core: 'core-id', //0 for host, and >=0 for a container
	command: 'command-id',
	message: {
		message: 'string', //the log message itself
		epoch: timestamp, //in nanosecond
		meta: uint, //meta flags
	}
}
```

## Meta flags
the meta is a unsigned 32 bit int formatted as follows:
- 2 high order bytes contains the log level (1 for stdout, and 2 for stderr)
- 2 lower order bytes contains flags associated with the message
	- flag: 0x2 EOF and process has exited with success
	- flag: 0x4 EOF and process has exited with error
	
### Example
```python
level = meta >> 16
eof = meta & 0x0006 != 0 #EOF regardless the exit state

if eof:
    return

if level == 1:
   stdout.write(message)
elif level == 2:
   stderr.write(message)
```

# Python client streaming
The python client exposes the stream functionality. Although the stream flag can work with 
any command (even the internal commands that doesn't start an external process), the python
client only exposes the `stream` flag on `system` and `bash` methods.
 
When u start a process via `system` or `bash` the stream method is available on the
`Respose` object. The `stream` method is what will start the actual copy of process output
from zero-os. Calling stream method without having the flag actually set on the call
will cause the stream method to block until the process exits, but it will not copy
any data since zero-os did not actually prepare any data for streaming

Check docstring for `stream` method for more details on how to use

## Example
```python
response = cl.bash('for i in $(seq 0 10); do echo "ping"; sleep 2s; done', stream=True)
response.stream() # by default will copy stream to sys.stdout and sys.stderr
## output
ping
ping
ping
ping
ping
ping
ping
ping
ping
ping
ping
